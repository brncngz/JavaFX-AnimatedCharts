# JavaFX-AnimatedCharts
My job is to write a program to create animated bar and line charts. I will be implementing a JavaFX GUI and the supporting classes to read and parse real-life data and plot animated bar and line charts.

# Software Design 
In this project, there has to show the the visiulization of some files in the form of animated graph and line chart. Files were of two types. One is the text file type and second was the uml file. Ä°n order to done this project, we have used javafx and intellij IDE. In solving the problems we have used javaFx tools that have to write in the form of fxml and other programming concepts like reading a text file etc.
In this project the use cases are that the buttons click listners are working and on click a specific button, a specific window related to that button opens and shows a animated graph of data reading from text file or uml file.
When we run the project, three buttons comes in the window having three buttons for three text files seprately.On clicking the specific button, a winow will open and shows the graph for data reading from a file.
To show a graph, there are three files related to that graph one is the frontend file like fxml file, one backend file java file and one file from where we have to read data. In java file functions are written like function to read data from file, button click listner and constructor method.


# Conclusion
In developing the project, errors were related to text reading from file from text file and from uml file. It takes time to resolve errors and getting correct output. After that we came across to the errors in grpah plotting and animation, since dataset is so large that it takes times to visualize the graph in window. In forming graph, the animation errors also occur that was runtime exceptions. After some time, all errors are gone. 
In my view, i have learned a lot in completing this project like reading a difficult text files and uml files and how to add them as object in arraylist. I have learned how to use graphs in javaFx.
